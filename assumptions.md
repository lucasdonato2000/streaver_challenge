# Assumptions

This document outlines the assumptions made about unclear or unspecified requirements in the project specification.

## User Filtering Implementation

**Requirement**: "allows the users to filter the posts by the userId of whoever wrote the post"

**Assumption**: The requirement specifies filtering by userId but doesn't specify the UI/UX implementation.

I assumed:
- Users don't know user IDs by memory, so they need to search by user name or username
- A searchable dropdown would be more user-friendly than requiring users to type a numeric ID
- The filtering happens behind the scenes using the userId, but the interface shows user names
- Users should see how many posts each user has written to make informed filtering decisions

**Implementation**: Created a searchable user filter that queries users by name/username and filters posts by the selected user's ID on the backend.

## Post Display and Ordering

**Requirement**: "lists all the posts returned by the database"

**Assumptions**:

1. **Post Order**: The requirement does not specify the ordering of posts, and they do not have a timestamp either.
   - The API returns posts grouped by user (posts 1-10 from user 1, posts 11-20 from user 2, etc.)
   - I assumed a community feed should show mixed posts from different users, not grouped by author
   - Implemented post shuffling in the seed script to randomize the order
   - Posts are displayed in insertion order (which is randomized) without additional sorting

2. **Pagination**: The requirement says "lists all the posts" but doesn't specify if they should all be on one page
   - Users connection was bad or unestable so it will be a problem if a big amount of posts is going to be rendered
   - I assumed 100 posts on a single page would hurt performance and UX
   - Implemented pagination with 8 posts per page
   - Added navigation controls (Previous/Next and page numbers)

3. **Cache**: When a user filter is applied, the requirement doesn't specify if pagination should reset
   - I assumed users would want to start from page 1 when changing filters
   - Implemented automatic reset to page 1 when a user filter is selected

## Delete Confirmation

**Requirement**: "When you click the Delete button a modal or dialog should appear asking for confirmation"

**Assumptions**:

1. **What happens after confirmation**: The requirement doesn't specify what happens if deletion fails or succeeds
   - I assumed the modal should close after successful deletion
   - I assumed the modal should stay open if deletion fails, showing the error inline
   - I assumed the user should be prevented from clicking the button multiple times (loading state)

2. **Where to show deletion errors**: The requirement says to show errors but doesn't specify where
   - I assumed errors should be shown within the post card that failed to delete (contextual feedback)
   - I assumed errors should be closeable by the user
   - I assumed the error should disappear when the user tries to delete again


## Error Handling Display

**Requirement**: "When the endpoint fails to retrieve the posts or it fails to delete an error should be shown to the user"

**Assumptions**:

1. **Error for post loading**: The requirement doesn't specify where to show this error
   - I assumed the error should appear at the top of the posts page where content would normally be
   - I assumed the error should explain what went wrong in user-friendly language
   - I assumed users don't need to see technical error details

2. **Error for user search**: The requirement doesn't mention user search errors at all
   - I assumed that if the user search fails, it should show an error in the dropdown
   - I assumed the error should be inline and not block the rest of the page
 

3. **Error testing capability**: The requirement doesn't specify how to test error states
   - I assumed developers need a way to trigger errors for testing without breaking the actual API
   - Implemented an environment variable system to simulate specific errors on demand
   - I assumed errors should be testable individually without affecting other features


## Data Seeding

**Requirement**: "use the data from these APIs to seed the tables"

**Assumption**:

**ID preservation**: The requirement doesn't specify whether to keep original IDs from the API
   - I assumed IDs should be auto-generated by the database (more realistic)
   - I assumed original IDs could cause issues with the shuffling implementation
   - Implemented ID mapping to maintain user-post relationships while allowing auto-increment



## Application Entry Point

**Requirement**: Create a /posts page that lists posts

**Assumption**: The requirement doesn't specify what happens at the root path (/)
- I assumed the main feature is viewing posts, so users should be automatically redirected to /posts
- Implemented a redirect from root (/) to /posts for better UX
- Did not implement a landing page as the posts list is the main feature

## User Permissions

**Requirement**: "Each post can be deleted"

**Assumption**: The requirement doesn't specify who can delete posts or if there should be authentication
- I assumed any user can delete any post (no authentication system)
- I assumed there are no user roles or permissions
- I assumed this is acceptable for a demo application
- Did not implement user login, sessions, or access control

## User Experience Enhancements

**Requirement**: "users usually travel a lot and are in places with bad or unstable internet connections"

**Assumption**: This requirement suggests the need for certain UX features that aren't explicitly specified
- I assumed caching is important to reduce redundant network requests
- I assumed showing loading states helps users understand the system is working despite slow connections
- I assumed retry logic would help when requests fail due to connection issues
- I assumed debouncing search inputs reduces unnecessary requests on slow connections
- Implemented these features even though not explicitly required
